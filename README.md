# Build

```bash
make team-manager
```

# Usage

1. Generate a GitHub token that has `admin:org`. [direct link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

2. Generate configuration for your organization

```bash
$ ./team-manager init --org cilium
Retrieving configuration from organization...
Creating configuration file "cilium-team-assignments.yaml"...
```

3. Modify your file accordingly the available options, for example (the yaml
   comments will not show up in the generated file and will be removed every time
   `./team-manager` is executed):

```yaml
organization: cilium
slackWorkspace: cilium.slack.com
# List of members that belong to the organization, ordered by GitHub login (username).
members:
  aanm:
    # User ID, retrieved from GitHub
    id: MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTQwNjY=
    # User real name, useful to know which person is behind a GitHub username.
    name: Andr√© Martins
    # Slack user ID, to ping folks on Slack.
    slackId: U3Z10R6HW
  borkmann:
    id: MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzM5Mw==

    # List of members' logins that belong to this team.
    members:
    - aanm
    - borkmann
    - joestringer
    # codeReviewAssignment
    codeReviewAssignment:
      # algorithm, currently can be LOAD_BALANCE or ROUND_ROBIN.
      algorithm: LOAD_BALANCE
      # set 'true' if codeReviewAssignment should be enabled.
      enabled: true
      # Notify the entire team of the PR if it is delegated.
      notifyTeam: false
      # List of members that should be excluded from receiving reviews, and an
      # optional reason.
      excludedMembers:
        # GitHub login name (username).
      - login: aanm
        reason: Want to be part of team 'bpf' but will not be assigned to leave
                reviews.
      # The number of team members to assign.
      teamMemberCount: 1
  policy:
    id: MDQ6VGVhbTI1MTk3ODY=
    members:
    - aanm
    - joestringer
    codeReviewAssignment:
      algorithm: LOAD_BALANCE
      enabled: true
      notifyTeam: true
      teamMemberCount: 1
# List of members that should be excluded from review assignments for the teams
# that they belong. This list can exist for numerous reasons, person is
# currently PTO or busy with other work.
excludeCodeReviewAssignmentFromAllTeams:
- borkmann
```

4. Once the changes stored in a local configuration file, run `./team-manager push --org cilium`:

```bash
$ ./team-manager push --org cilium
